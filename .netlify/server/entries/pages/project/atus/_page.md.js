<p>This project was built using vanilla JavaScript, and styling was done with assistance from <a href="${"https://bulma.io/"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">Bulma</a>. It was rather easy to build. It was one of my first JS projects and so it was mostly an attempt to learn \u{1F642}.</p>
<p>Methodologically, for each demographic profile (a combination of race, age, marital status), I found the most common activities at every given time. (Technically, I grouped per hour to prevent issues with low N\u2019s). I would then display that activity to the user, given their parameters. If that didn\u2019t fit (according to the user), I would show the second most common activity, and so on!</p>
