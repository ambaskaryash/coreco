<p>Goals are deceiving. They seem to be what we\u2019re working toward, but they give us little to no actual motivation to achieve them.  </p>
<p>An analogy I often use is working out. Going to the gym with a goal (\u201CI want to get strong, or look more fit\u201D) is most commonly why people buy a gym membership, and why they eventually cancel it. Real results take time, and lofty goals set standards that soon seem unattainable after they don\u2019t bear results. </p>
<p><strong>A better approach would be to form habits</strong>. Habits are less sexy, but more successful, because they bear results no matter our goals. A new gym goer is more likely to be successful if they have <em>something getting them to the gym</em>, such as a personal trainer, a friend, or a gym community.</p>
<p>In the same way, people learn not because of their goals, but because of their habits. Doing the same thing every day will inevitably bear results. (The quality of those results will depend on how efficacious your habits really are).</p>
<p>Find the things that make you excited to learn, or at the very least find the things that force you to learn (ideally, the former). Practically, that might be:</p>
<ul><li>A daily \u2018coding block\u2019, where you invest time into learning (e.g. 6 - 8pm on weeknights).</li>
<li>An accountability partner you learn with, or report regular updates to </li>
<li>???? TK TK</li></ul>
<p>These kind of small tweaks ensure you spend enough time doing the things that help you learn.</p>
<h1 id="${"follow-the-right-people"}"><a href="${"#follow-the-right-people"}">Follow the right people</a></h1>
<p>There\u2019s a common adage that you are the average of your five closest friends. A slightly-less-punchy but more way-more-accurate adage is: <strong>you learn from the people you follow</strong>. </p>
<p>The quickest way to learn in the long run is to surround yourself with people who feed you knowledge passively. </p>

<p>This kind of tip requires a sort of rethinking of how we learn. We tend to think of learning as an <em>active process</em>, where you seek out information, commit time, and give attention to the topic at hand. In contrast, finding the right people to follow is a <em>passive approach to learning</em>, where you come across informative and helpful information sporadically and intermittently (FIXME these are the same words).</p>
<p>Some of the most helpful tips I\u2019ve encountered have been <strong>_</strong>\u2026.</p>
<p>Following people who learn in public and who learn with an active curiosity has exposed me to \u2026</p>
<h1 id="${"commit-at-least-10-hours"}"><a href="${"#commit-at-least-10-hours"}">Commit at least 10 hours</a></h1>
<p>Learning can actually be quite fun once you get past \u201Cthe tipping point.\u201D But the first few hours of learning anything are almost always frustrating.</p>
<p>You have to persevere up until that tipping point. Be patient with the hard parts, get frustrated, and get confused. I don\u2019t know if I made up this rule (I did make up the number, to my knowledge), but <strong>you should always commit at least 10 hours toward something before giving up</strong>. If, after those 10 hours, you\u2019re still frustrated and confused, it might be worth abandoning (or rethinking your approach). </p>
<p>But those 10 hours tend to be the time when we get over the hurdles, get our first wins, and start to really understand the topic at hand.</p>

<h1 id="${"learn-in-public"}"><a href="${"#learn-in-public"}">Learn in public</a></h1>
<p>A good way to hold yourself accountable, get feedback, and learn from others is to <strong>learn in public</strong>. </p>

<p>I had (and still have) a bad habit of judging the value of my work by how many Twitter likes it receives. <strong>This is awful</strong> (please learn from me). It can be paralyzing when you spend 100+ hours on a project only to post it and for it to receive a couple dozen likes.</p>
<p>I think this is a common mistake among people who try to \u201Clearn in public,\u201D because we associate <em>learning</em> with <em>sharing</em> and <em>sharing</em> with <em>validation</em>. If the work that we share does not receive a lot attention, we assume it was a failure.</p>
<p>The trick here is to think of yourself as a <strong>participant in the conversation</strong>, not <strong>a creator for the public</strong>. You should be learning <em>in public</em> and <em>with the public</em>, not <em>for the public</em>. Your work (early on) will not be changing the world, and that\u2019s okay. Participating in the conversation, and engaging with a community of like-minded people, will bear results beyond external validation.</p>

<p>Back to my gym analogy from above. After a few years of lifting, with peaks and valleys of enjoying it, I\u2019ve found a surefire strategy to keep me going even when I\u2019m not in the mood: <strong>cutting out the bad stuff</strong>. There are certain exercises I just <em>hate</em>, like bulgarian split squats and dumbbell rows (sorry, gym bros). </p>
<p>Now, I know that the decision to go to the gym is an intentional one, and that I decide to do so based on an implicit calculation of pros, cons, and perceived enjoyment of going. Before I go, I ask myself (in my head), \u201Cwill I enjoy this workout?\u201D</p>
<p>By cutting out the bad stuff, I make myself that much more likely to get up and actually hit the gym.</p>
<p>Deciding to learn is an active process that you negotiate by asking yourself, \u201Cis this really worth my time?\u201D, which inevitably leads to the question, \u201Chow much will I dislike this?\u201D By cutting out the bad stuff, you dislike learning a bit less, and the rational part of your brain likes learning that much more.</p>
<p>Avoid (within reason), the things about learning that you dread. Is there a topic you dread, or a method that you don\u2019t vibe with (e.g. reading)? Avoid it. If you can. Do whatever you can to make yourself <em>excited</em> to learn, so that you form the habits of getting started\u2014once you\u2019re in the weeds, maybe the dreadful stuff won\u2019t seem too bad.</p>
