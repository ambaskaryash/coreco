to convene a campus-wide discussion regarding the risks and benefits of
opening campus. The petition garnered nearly 100 faculty signatures.</p>
<p>Despite such complaints, Rice opened its doors to in-person students on
August 11th. And despite all of the concerns, the university has done a
remarkable job at keeping COVID case counts relatively low.</p>

<p>In addition to the criticism leveled against university administrators
for jeopardizing the health and safety of their <em>students</em>, to what
extent have reopenings put the community at large at greater risk?</p>
<p>One way to answer this question is to analyze case counts attributable
to university students as a relative proportion of a county\u2019s overall
case counts. The New York Times offers data in both forms:
<a href="${"https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/tree/master/colleges"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">college-affiliated
cases</a>
and <a href="${"https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data/blob/master/live/us-counties.csv"}" rel="${"nofollow"}">county
cases</a>
(cumulative). In combination, the data tells a story about which
colleges are struggling the most with COVID-19, which college towns saw
a COVID spike after university reopenings, and which cities have
problems much larger than students throwing fraternity parties.</p>
<p>Below, you can explore your county\u2019s case count relative to its
university-affiliated case counts.</p>
${validate_component(TableHandler, "TableHandler").$$render(
        $$result,
        {
          src: "/images/post/covid-on-campus/table2.png",
          alt: "A table showcasing counties that have the greatest number of COVID-19 cases attributable to colleges. Pickens, South Carolina is expanded, showcasing two universities which account for 105% of the county's total cases. Last updated October 11, 2020",
          link: "http://connorrothschild.github.io/v2/post/covid-on-campus/",
          width: "80%"
        },
        {},
        {}
      )}
<p>In two counties, Otsego County (New York) and Pickens County (South
Carolina), university-affiliated COVID-19 case counts actually <em>outpace</em>
officially recorded COVID-19 cases in their respective counties. This
might signal an issue with the data, or a unique way of treating
university students in county-wide case counts. According to one of the
investigative reporters who recorded this data at the New York Times,
county-wide case totals might not include out-of-state residents, such
as college students:</p>
<blockquote class="${"twitter-tweet"}"><p lang="${"en"}" dir="${"ltr"}">Coronavirus infections on campuses might go unnoticed if not for reporting by academic institutions themselves because they do not always show up in official state or countywide tallies, which generally exclude people who have permanent addresses elsewhere, as students often do.</p>\u2014 Danielle Ivory (@danielle_ivory) <a href="${"https://twitter.com/danielle_ivory/status/1314597852782489602?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw"}">October 9, 2020</a></blockquote>
<p>In other counties, we see a more intuitive picture, where college cases
constitute a proportion of overall county cases. Even if the same issue
is present in these counties, you can understand generally where
university COVID case counts are high relative to their county-wide
totals, and where they are not.</p>
<h3 id="${"university-affiliated-covid-cases-across-states"}"><a href="${"#university-affiliated-covid-cases-across-states"}">University-affiliated COVID cases across states</a></h3>
<p>The data also tells a story about COVID case counts on a state-by-state
basis, and where college-affiliated cases make up a disproportionate
share of cases in the state overall.</p>
<p>Geographically, the data looks like this (note the x-axis runs from 0 to
10%):</p>
${validate_component(Image, "Image").$$render(
        $$result,
        {

        {},

which counties within your state make up the greatest share of COVID-19
cases.</p>
